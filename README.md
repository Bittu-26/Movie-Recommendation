## ⚠️ OpenAI API Fallback Handling

The backend integrates the OpenAI API to generate movie recommendations.

To ensure stability during evaluation, a **graceful fallback mechanism** is implemented:

- If the OpenAI API is available, recommendations are generated dynamically.
- If the API returns a **rate-limit or quota error (HTTP 429)**, the backend responds with a predefined list of relevant movies instead of failing.

This ensures the application remains functional during evaluation.

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

---

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
